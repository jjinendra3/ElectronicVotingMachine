#  üó≥Ô∏èElectronic Voting System

The goal of this project is to build a functioning prototype of an Electronic Voting Machine. 
It could be utilized to hold elections for various designations and positions inside an organization.The Electronic Voting System (EVS) is a computer-based system used to securely cast and count votes in elections. It is designed to replace the traditional paper-based voting system, providing a reliable and secure way for citizens to cast their votes. 

This system is designed to provide: 
* Increased accuracy in the voting process.
* Increased security of the voting process. 
* Increased speed of the voting process.
* Increased transparency of the voting process.

## Features 
* User authentication: The system will require users to authenticate themselves with a username and password. This ensures that only registered and eligible voters can cast their votes. 
* Vote casting: The system will provide a secure and user-friendly interface for users to cast their vote. This includes providing a list of candidates and allowing users to select their choice. 
* Real-time results: The system will provide real-time results so that the outcome of the election is known immediately after the polls close. 
* Auditability: The system will provide an audit trail so that the results can be verified and any irregularities can be identified. 
* Security:The system is designed and implemented with security as a top priority. The system will protect user data and votes. Access to the system will be restricted to authorized personnel only, and all communication between the system and users will be secure. 

## üñ•Ô∏èSystem Requirements 
* Operating System: Windows, Linux, Mac OS 
* System Requirements: g++ compiler
* Programming Language: C
